In todayâ€™s fast-paced lifestyle, common health issues like headaches, fatigue, stomach discomfort, and skin irritation are often neglected due to time limitations, medical expenses, and concerns about chemical side effects. The Instant Heal Chatbot provides instant, side-effect-free home remedies using traditional Indian practices such as Ayurveda, yoga, breathing techniques, and mudras. It offers users natural, holistic suggestions to address their health concerns without relying on expensive medicines or frequent doctor visits.

The app also incorporates AI to detect specific skin diseases and provide relevant remedies, enhancing its capability to assist with common skin-related issues.
